Today, we are Wasting Paper! 

We are a Rock band from Hamilton, Ontario. Formed by Dan and Julian, we originally played in Hamilton under the name John Thomas. After the 2020 break, we are returning under a new name. We try to make loud noises that people like to hear. All rights reserved. Patent pending.

Our first album called Bits & Parts is coming out soon, early 2023. Keep an eye out here for updates and also follow us on social media. You can find our social links below.
